<h1 style="font-family: Arial;">The Story of this App<br>
</h1>

<big style="font-family: Arial;"><big><small>Welcome to the
world of Pico Fermi Bagel. This is a game my children
and I were taught to play by a family friend when the boys were in
Elementary School. Its a logic game that involves numbers and requires
healthy doses of deductive reasoning, informed guessing, and often
just a touch of luck to master. Some research has taught me that the
game is no secret with others. Many have written and published games to
play it
well before this effort. It has even showed
up in at least one book. The one I am familiar with is titled, "Family
Math" by Jean Kerr Stenmark, Virginia
Thompson, and Ruth Cossey. There are many references to the game, its
history, and how to play it on the internet and I encourage anyone
interested to seek them out. For my family and me, the game has
remained a perennial favorite well beyond the elementary math years
most say the game targets. So in an effort to stay technically current
as my professional career has wound down, I took on the task of
capturing our family's favorite game as a fun and challenging app in
this brave new world of mobile computing. I took some liberties to
enhance the game to both increase its challenge and to make it more
fun. Though honestly, the "classic" mode is still plenty fun enough for
most. </small></big></big><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<big style="font-family: Arial;"><big><small><br>
I invite
you to sit down with the app on your favorite mobile phone (not available yet) or tablet
and give it a whirl. Hopefully, the game will become as 'addictive' for you as
my
family found it.</small><br>
</big></big>
<br style="font-family: Arial;">

<h1 style="font-family: Arial;">The Basic Game</h1>

<big style="font-family: Arial;">This is a guessing game in
that your objective is to deduce, in the
correct order, the series of numbers that the computer has randomly
selected. For each game a new random selection is made. Any given game will have both a multi-digit
number to guess and a set of numbers to select from. In the "Classic"
game as I learned it, there is a 3 digit number with each digit being
chosen from the integers between 0 and 9. One other "rule" is that in a
valid guess, no digit can be repeated. So for instance, a valid guess
would be "234" but not "233".<br>
<br>

The way you will helped to figure out what the "secret" number the
computer has chosen (I refer to this as the '<span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>') is that on
each guess, you will be provided some feedback on how the digits in
your guess relate to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>'s digits. The feedback will come
in the form of 1 of 3 possible responses you will get for each digit in
your guess. For your guess, you will be told how many of your digits
are:<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Pico -
meaning you have a digit that is in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> though it is not in
the right position ..... think "position"... this is good news in that
you know your close.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fermi -
meaning you have a digit that is in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> and it is in the
right position !!!! .... think "firm" ... this is great news as this
means you have a part of the solution in hand even if you may not know
which digit(s) is/are "Fermi".<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Bagel<sup>1</sup>-
meaning you have a digit that is simply not part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> ...
think of the bagel shape signifying "a big Zero" ... this could be very valuable information because
knowing a number that is definitely not in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> can be
quite valuable in helping you&nbsp; determine which numbers are in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> and maybe even in helping to identify their proper positions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<small style="font-style: italic;">1- This is a slight deviation from
the original game I learned in that I
will tell you how many digits are "bagels" in your guess whereas the
original game only declared an entire answer to be a "bagel" when no
digits were a pico or a fermi. Both the traditional game and my version
are giving you the same information though I spare you a little simple
arithmetic. </small><br>
<br>
</big>
<h1 style="font-family: Arial;">A Sample "Classic" Game</h1>

<big style="font-family: Arial;">So let's work thru a sample
game. Say the computer generated<span style="font-style: italic;"> Target</span> is "385" and the
possible set of digits are from 0 - 9. Let's follow a set of guesses,
the feedback given, and some of the reasoning you might use to deduce
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>.<br>
<br>
<br>
</big>
<div style="margin-left: 80px; font-family: Arial;"><big><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Guess&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">
Feedback&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"></span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 80px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>&nbsp;123&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Pico, 0 Fermi, 2 Bagel<small>s</small><br>
<br>
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>
</big>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>&nbsp;At this point I know either
the
'1', the '2', or the '3' are in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> and the other two numbers are not.
I'll try to learn more and somewhat randomly choose the last digit to
replace<br>
</big></div>
<big><br>
<br>
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 80px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>&nbsp;124&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 Pico, 0 Fermi, 3 Bagels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>
</big>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>&nbsp;Excellent! My guess paid
off, now
I know '1','2', and '4' are not in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> and that '3' is though
not in the last spot. Let's move the '3' around and try to find the
other digits of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span><br>
</big></div>
<big><br>
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 80px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>356&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1 Pico, 1 Fermi, 1 Bagel&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>
</big>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>&nbsp;Hummm. The '3' could be the
Fermi
or it could be the Pico. Also, either the '5' or the '6' is in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> but not both. I'm going to take the chance the '3' is the Fermi,
which would then imply either the '5' or '6' needs to be in the other's
position. I'll go with the '5' for no good reason other than it is
chronologically after the '3'<br>
</big></div>
<big><br>
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 80px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>&nbsp;375&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0 Pico, 2 Fermis, 1
Bagel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>
</big>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><big>&nbsp; Ok, now I know I have the
'3'
and the '5' correct. I am sure the '7' isn't one of the Fermi's because,
if it were, that would imply the '6' from the previous guess should
have been a "Fermi" which it wasn't. Now I'm also sure the '3' is
also one of the Fermi's, so on to replacing the '7' to find whether its
position should be filled with the '8' or '9' given they are only
two digits yet to be tried<br>
</big></div>
<big><br>
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 80px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>&nbsp;385&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
</big></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial;"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !!!!! A WINNER
in 5 guesses !!!!!<br>
</big></div>

<big style="font-family: Arial;"><br>

Hopefully you know get a sense for how the game is played.</big><br style="font-family: Arial;">

<br style="font-family: Arial;">

<h1 style="font-family: Arial;">The Game as played in PicoFermiBagel</h1>

<br style="font-family: Arial;">

<h2 style="font-family: Arial;">The basic screen</h2>

<big style="font-family: Arial;">The screen is as shown
below. Each major section is identified and will be further described
below.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 742px; height: 751px;" alt="" src="pfb_opening.png"><br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Section
A</span> - the Menu Area. This
menu (often referred to as the app's "hamburger" menu) will cause a menu of
choices to become visible optionally allowing you to start a new game,
buy "cheats", change the game's basic setup, clear stored state<!-- , check out the Leader Board -->, etc.
The menu can be dismissed with no selections by tapping any area
outside of it. A tap on a label in the menu will invoke that option.<br>
<br>
</big>
</big>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Arial;"><big><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The one option worth saying more about is "Set-up".
If you select this option, you will be able to change the games
'difficulty'. The game is made more difficult by increasing the number
of digits in the computer generated<span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>
(and requires a corresponding change in the # of rows and
columns in the guess input area) as well as increases in the range of
digits that each position can be selected from. The other
user-settable options should be self-explanatory. If something is
changed that affects the play of a game (versus just an appearance or
convenience option), the game will be restarted when you navigate back
to the main game page.<br>
</big></big></div>

<big style="font-family: Arial;"><big><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Section B</span> - the Guess Area. A
digit of the guess will be entered when a number in the Selection Area
is tapped. The "active" guess digit position is identified by the green
outline of the rectangle in the guess&nbsp; area. The green rectangle
is automatically advanced after a guess position is filled by a tap on
a selection number or can be
manually selected by tapping a box. The automatic advancement can be
forced to skip a location by double tapping the guess position's box
to cause the "pad lock" image to show up. An additional tap will remove
the "pad lock" image and the position is again a candidate for
automatic advancement via tapped selections. Additionally, those that
would prefer, are welcome to 'drag' a digit from the selection set and
'drop' it on to one of the guess locations. "Drag-n-drop" guessing does
not affect the "active" guess location and can be combined with tapped
selections as you see fit. You can also 'exchange' two guess positions by dragging one guess number on to another.<br>
<br>

A number displayed in '<span style="color: rgb(240, 0, 0);">red</span>' in the guess area is being flagged as being a repeated digit.
Until this repeated digit problem is resolved, the 'Submit' button will
not be active. Likewise, all red '<span style="color: red;">-</span>'s (Dashes) also must be replaced
with a valid digit before the "Submit' button is activated.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Section C</span> - the Selection Area.
In this area, the set of digits that are available to guess with is
displayed. When one of these numbers is tapped, whichever box in the
guest area that is outlined in green will be filled with the tapped
digit. Alternatively, as previously mentioned, a selection number can
be 'dragged' and subequently 'dropped' onto a guess location. Numbers
in this area are displayed with a light grey background just to show
you that
they have already been used at least once in the guess area.
Additionally, background
coloration is used to indicate numbers that have been "bought" (there
is an optional way to buy 'hints' (aka cheats). The coloration will
reflect the hint bought and will use the background color key shown in
the header for
section F, the Scratchpad area.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Note</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">:</span> There is an option available in the Setup submenu to have the
Selection Area placed above the Guess Area versus the default (as
shown) where it resides below it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Section D</span> - the Optional
Display Area. This area can optionally display the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> the computer has selected for learning purposes. This
option is selected via the menu of Section A. <!-- Please note that if you display the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> then your score for that game will not be eligible for display on the Leader Board maintained for each difficulty level. --><br>
<br>
</big></big><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<big style="font-family: Arial;"><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Section E</span></big></big><big style="font-family: Arial;"><big> -
Hint Purchasing Area. This area displays shortcuts for buying "hints" to help you guess the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>. Two types of hints are available. <br>
<br>
The first lets you buy one of
the potential numbers in the Selection Set and have it identified as </big></big><big style="font-family: Arial;"><big>being definitely not in (ie a Bagel) the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>&nbsp; </big></big><big style="font-family: Arial;"><big>or conversely be identified
as definitely in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> (ie Not a Bagel ... meaning it is guaranteed to be a Pico or a Fermi when used in a guess)<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>. <br>
<br>
The second type of hint you could buy is a Row Delta. A Row
Delta hint will provide</big></big><big style="font-family: Arial;"><big>
feedback as to how the sum of each digit in a row of the
guess compares to the sum of the digits in the corresponding row of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>. The difference in row sums will be
displayed in Section I, the Feedback Area and will first show up as a
magnitude (a +/- indication is shown to make it clear
that the value shown only tells you the absolute difference between the
row sums and not which sum is greater then or less than the other).
Once sufficient 'Row Delta' hints have been bought to have all row's
displaying the delta sum magnitude information, the next 'Row Delta'
hint purchased will switch all rows to display the actual amount the
guess row's sum would need to increase (a positive value) or decrease
(a negative value) to equal the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> row's sum.</big></big><big style="font-family: Arial;"><big><br>
</big></big><br style="font-family: Arial;">
<big style="font-family: Arial;"><big>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Section F</span> - the Scratchpad
Area. This are is provided strictly as a memory or thinking aid for the
player. It has nothing to do with scoring or guessing. The numbers
displayed can be tapped to cycle them through a series of colors that
each can be associated with a meaning. The color key displayed directly
above them is provided to
show the meanings I have associated with the colors but in reality
they really could be interpreted however you'd like. The one caveat is
that when the "Buy a Number" hint is bought (identifying a number that
is definitely a "bagel" or "not a bagel") the background of the
corresponding
number in the Scratchpad area turns either the orange 'bagel' color or
the blue/green 'not-a-bagel' color.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Section G</span> - the Scoring Area.
The score is something that you are trying to maximize. The best score
is thus the higest or closest to 100. The score is calculated as the :<br>
</big>
</big>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-family: Arial;"><big><big>score
= 100 -&nbsp; (the # of guesses) + (the number of minutes the game has been active
for) + (the cost of any "hints" purchased)<br>
<br>
An average scored is maintained and displayed for each "difficulty"
level selectable from the games set-up page (accessible from the
"hamburger menu" in Section A.<br>
<br>
</big></big></div>

<big style="font-family: Arial;"><big><!-- While I am discussing scoring,
let me take a minute to discuss the Leader Board this app maintains.
For each difficulty level, a seperate Leader Board is maintained. When
you complete a game (without having exposed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>),
details of your game will be posted to the&nbsp; appropriate Leader
Board and your rank on it will be presented. The Leader Board is kept
out in the 'cloud' so your Leader Board "rank" shows how you have done
versus all others who have won games at that difficulty level. Right
after you win a game, the Leader Board is presented. At that time, and
only at that time, you are free to enter your name or initials in the
highlighted area for the game you just won. Just tap in that area to
bring up a keyboard. Only 10 letters are kept so don't go crazy. Once
you enter something in this area, it is remembered to seed the field
the next time a game is won on that device. If you are happy with
what's displayed, do nothing. If you like to change it, just tap on the
highlighted field again and make whatever changes you'd like. Again
these will be remembered for the next win. To exit, use the navigation
at the top of the page to return to the main game page. --><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Section H</span> - the Submit/New Game
Button Area. This button is selected to 'submit' your guess for
evaluation and feedback. Until the button is tapped, you are free to
change your guess as many times as you'd like. After its selected, the
guess will be assessed to determine if you have won i.e. your guess
matches exactly the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>, and, if not a perfect match, how
many picos, fermis, and bagels it contains. This information is
conveyed in Section H, the Feedback Area. The "Submit' button will
be deactivated until there is a valid guess in the Guess area. This
means that the guess area contains only non-repeating numbers and no
red '<span style="color: red;">-<span style="color: rgb(14, 0, 0);">'</span></span> (Dashes).<br>
<br>
Also, once a game is won, the 'Submit' button changes to a 'New Game'
button to facilitate starting a new game. Alternatively, a new game can
be selected from the "hamburger" menu in the upper right of the screen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Section I </span>- the Feedback Area.
This scrollable area displays every guess that is made and the
appropriate feedback on how that guess relates to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span>.
Displayed information is the guess number, the guess itself, and the
indication of the number of picos, fermis, and bagels the guess
contains. Optionally, based on an appropriate purchase of 'Row Delta'
hints, the feedback as to how the sum of each digit in a row of the
guess compares to the sum of the digits in the corresponding row of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Target</span> can be displayed. <br>
