# 🔍 Subscription Flow Debug Guide

## Current Status:
✅ **Subscription resolver works** - Returns correct data when called directly
✅ **Database updates** - Interest count increases to 3 
✅ **Mutation succeeds** - `announceLobbyEntry` succeeds
❌ **No subscription callbacks** - Clients never receive updates

## The Missing Link:

AppSync subscriptions should auto-trigger when:
1. `updateDifficultyInterestWithNotification` mutation succeeds
2. AppSync detects the mutation completion
3. AppSync calls the `onDifficultyInterestUpdate` subscription resolver
4. AppSync pushes the result to all subscribed clients

## Possible Issues:

### 1. **Subscription Schema Mismatch**
The subscription might not be properly linked to the mutation.

### 2. **Missing @aws_subscribe Directive**
AppSync might need explicit subscription triggers.

### 3. **Resolver Publishing**
The mutation resolver might need to explicitly publish to subscriptions.

### 4. **Client Subscription Setup**
The client might not be subscribing correctly.

## Debug Steps:

1. **Check AppSync Logs** - Look for subscription trigger events
2. **Verify Schema Links** - Ensure subscriptions are linked to mutations  
3. **Test Manual Trigger** - Try triggering subscription manually
4. **Check Client Logs** - Verify subscription setup

## Expected Client Logs:
```
🎮 MultiplayerService: Subscribing to difficulty interest updates via GraphQL
🎮 MultiplayerService: Received difficulty interest update: {...}
🎮 MultiplayerService: Subscription data: [...]
🎮 MultiplayerService: Processed subscription updates: [...]
```

## Current Client Logs:
```
🎮 MultiplayerService: Subscribing to difficulty interest updates via GraphQL
(MISSING ALL CALLBACK LOGS!)
```

This confirms subscriptions are not being triggered by mutations.
